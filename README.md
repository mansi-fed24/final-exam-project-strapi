## 1. What are Strapi CMS's main strengths (at least 3) according to you?

1. **Flexible Content Structure:**

   * In Strapi, I can easily create different content types like books, users, and ratings. It allows me to define relationships between these content types, making it easy to organize data.

2. **API-First Approach:**

   * Strapi automatically creates APIs for all content types. This is great for practicing frontend development because I can connect my frontend to the backend using these APIs.

3. **User Roles and Permissions:**

   * Strapi lets me manage different user roles and set permissions for each type of user, like Admin, Editor, and Public. This is useful for controlling what different users can access or update.

## 2. What are Strapi CMS's weaknesses (at least 2) in your opinion?

1. **Debugging Issues:**

   * When something goes wrong, finding the exact problem in Strapi can be tricky. The error messages are not always clear, and debugging requires checking multiple files and configurations.

2. **Complexity for Beginners:**

   * Strapi has many advanced features that can be confusing, especially when dealing with custom routes, services, or controllers. It’s not as straightforward as frontend development.

## 3. How has your experience been with working with Strapi?

My experience with Strapi was mostly good. I liked using it because it helped me practice frontend development by providing a backend where I could store data and practice using APIs. I also think it’s a great tool to build small projects like e-commerce sites, which I can showcase when applying for jobs.

However, since I am still learning, some parts were difficult. Debugging was especially tough because it’s more complicated than fixing frontend issues. Sometimes, I didn’t know where to look when things broke – whether it was in the backend, the API calls, or the frontend code.

## 4. What would have been the reasons to use a different CMS than Strapi in this project, and which CMS you could have used instead?

1. **If I Wanted Built-in E-commerce Features:**

   * If I wanted to add a shopping cart, checkout, and payment system, I would have used Shopify instead. Shopify already has these features, while in Strapi, I would have to build them from scratch.

2. **If I Wanted to Focus More on Blogging and SEO:**

   * If the project was mainly about blogging with SEO features, I would have used WordPress. WordPress has plugins for SEO, analytics, and themes, making it easier to set up a blog quickly.
